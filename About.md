# Road map/Versions #
~~For now road map can be understand by looking in [Issues](Issues.md) page: creating of pluggable framework for validation rules definition and execution.~~

  * Milestone-BeforeValidationRules
> Understand RCP, extension points, EPF framework - how to extend
  * Milestone-ValidationRulesImpl
> Enumerate sample validation rules and implement them
  * Milestone-ValidationAPI
> Generalize validation rules needs and create something like API for accessing UMA model so creation of new validation rules should become easy task
  * Milestone-Deploying
> Add product, update site, manual plugins, etc.
  * Milestone-Release1.0
> Add functionality to use extensions from third party plugins, make easy deployable, maven project, etc.
